In this chapter we will:

    introduce lambda functions (or anonymous functions).

    learn how to use the built-in map, filter or reduce with lambda functions to process data collections efficiently.

    learn about list comprehensions and how that can get rid of complex nested loops.

    look at variations of list comprehensions, e.g. dictionary comprehensions.
