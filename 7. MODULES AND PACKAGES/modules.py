# MODULES AND PACKAGES
"""
In this topic we will:

    learn what is modular programming.

    be introduced to the programming concept of namespaces.

    see how we can use packages to provide a hierarchical structure to our modules

    learn how to use other modules (or libraries) in our code.
"""
#  STEP 1 Define a Module
# Type the following code in a file called my_module.py, and save it:
my_string = "I am inevitable."
lucky_number = 21

def do_something():
    print('Tell me why, and I tell you why not.')

"""
This actually defines a module my_module, with the following elements in it:
a string my_string

a number lucky_number

a function do_something()
