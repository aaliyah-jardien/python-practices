# creating a calculator program

# declare variables
num1 = int(input("Input first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Input second number: "))

# naming variables with expressions
# addition function
total = num1 + num2

# subtraction function
difference = num1 - num2

# multiplication
product = num1 * num2

# division function
result = num1 / num2

# printing answers
print("sum: " + str(total))

print("difference: " + str(difference))

print("product: " + str(product))

print("result: " + str(result))

# the input values was converted from strings to integers then
# for the results it had to be converted back to strings

# CALCULATOR WITHOUT DEFINED FUNCTIONS
