"""
In built functions

print() - displays values

len() - counts number of characters or items in a string

type() - returns data type of an object

isinstance() - returns type of object as 2 arguements, as true or false

input() - allows user to input info

int() - converts user input to an integer

str() - converts user input to a string

flaot() - converts user input to a float
"""


# Note that the biggest difference is that giving the type function one object as an argument,e.g. type(num1) will result in the object type itself, e.g. <class 'int'>

# The isinstance function on the other hand has to get two arguments, e.g. isinstance(number, float) will yield true or false as a result. This means that isinstance() checks if the first argument given to it is of the same type as the second argument. For example isinstance(number, float) yields the output false because the number variable is not of type float
